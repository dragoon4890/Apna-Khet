# Apna Khet
## Overview

Developed in just 24 hours for MIT 2022 Hack Solstice, this project aims to improve farming practices of farmers in India by providing various insights such as the fertilizer they should use, how much water should be supplied to their irrigation system, recommended crop to be planted and many more. In India, the predominant factor for agricultural setbacks is a lack of precise information. With Apna Khet, we hope to change that by providing accurate details in all aspects of farming to avoid unnecessary losses. Our goal was to empower farmers and agricultural professionals with valuable data on fertilizer, pesticide, and other crop management products. Apna Khet primarily uses machine learning and data scraping to achive these objectives.

This project was created by Harsh Kumar Singh, Arnav Upadhyay, Anuron Dutta and Subhrajyoti Ghosh.

## Manage your crops 
Utilizing a dataset of around 87,000 images, Apna Khet allows farmers to easily identify the most common crop diseases with the power of computer vision. Moreover, depending on the users location, Apna Khet recommends crop choices taking into account a variety of factors such as but not limited to season, soil type, crop price, etc.

## Manage your chemicals
Using an exhaustive list published by the Departement of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Apna Khet can recommend what chemical to use based on the crop and problem with the crop, along with this proper usage methodology is also explained. The list of chemicals it can recommend are Insecticides, Fungicides, Herbicides and Plant Growth Hormone Regulators.

## Manage your water
Apna Khet can be used to calculate the amount of water your farm needs in a day to grow your crops in the most optimal way. It uses web scraping to get the rainfall data for the area the user is in. This allows for a more precise calculation of water needed per square kilometer.

## Features to be Implemented
A robust profiling system with log-in authorization to allow users to only have to enter details once when first starting as opposed to every use case in the current system.
An avatar system allowing for additional flavour and a personal touch to user profiles, users would be able to customize their avatars choosing from default options.
